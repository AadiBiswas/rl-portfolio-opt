# Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization

This project applies deep reinforcement learning to the problem of dynamic portfolio allocation in financial markets. Using agents like PPO and DDPG, we aim to develop and benchmark strategies across different market conditions and risk settings.

## Goals
- Simulate and evaluate trading agents using historical market data
- Model transaction costs, slippage, and risk-adjusted returns
- Extend environments and policy networks for practical portfolio management<br><br>
